# Crozet - [C++] An audio recording/processing/streaming library

Crozet is a library built on [SciPP](https://github.com/Reiex/SciPP), [Diskon](https://github.com/Reiex/Diskon) and [PortAudio](http://www.portaudio.com/) for audio recording, processing and streaming. The goal is to have a simple interface with microphones and speakers and to allow sounds recorded or read from files to be efficiently processed and streamed on speakers.
